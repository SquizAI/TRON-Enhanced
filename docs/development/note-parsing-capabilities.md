- Automatic indentation and nesting
- Parent-child relationship mapping
- Outlining and numbering systems

**Example Use Case:** Dictation using phrases like "main point" and "sub-point" creates properly nested and formatted outlines automatically.

## 10. Cross-Reference Detection

**Description:** Identifies relationships between notes in different categories and establishes links.

**Implementation Details:**
- Entity recognition across note collections
- Semantic similarity detection
- Bidirectional link creation
- Visualization of connected content

**Example Use Case:** A recipe note is automatically linked to the shopping list containing its ingredients, and each ingredient in the shopping list links back to recipes that use it.

## 11. Domain-Specific Formatting

**Description:** Applies specialized formatting based on recognized content domains.

**Implementation Details:**
- Formatting templates for different note types (legal, medical, academic)
- Domain detection based on terminology and structure
- Automatic application of appropriate styles and organization
- Compliance with domain-specific standards

**Example Use Case:** Legal content is automatically formatted with numbered paragraphs and proper citation formatting.

## 12. Decision Support Framework

**Description:** Recognizes decision-making content and structures it into formal decision matrices.

**Implementation Details:**
- Decision factor extraction
- Options and alternatives organization
- Pros/cons identification and formatting
- Weighting and priority detection

**Example Use Case:** A pros and cons dictation is formatted into a decision matrix with weighted factors and highlighted recommendations.

## 13. Longitudinal Note Integration

**Description:** Detects when new dictation extends previous notes on the same topic.

**Implementation Details:**
- Topic continuity detection
- Chronological ordering of related content
- Smart merging or appending of related notes
- Version history tracking for evolving notes

**Example Use Case:** New dictation on a previously discussed topic offers to extend the existing note rather than creating a duplicate.

## 14. Audience-Aware Parsing

**Description:** Identifies intended audience and applies appropriate formatting and detail level.

**Implementation Details:**
- Audience marker detection in natural language
- Formality level adjustment
- Detail scaling based on audience needs
- Terminology adaptation for different readers

**Example Use Case:** Content marked "for the team" vs. "for clients" receives different formatting, detail levels, and terminology explanations.

## 15. Multi-Modality Content Structuring

**Implementation Details:**
- Visual content marker detection
- Placeholder creation for diagrams and images
- Descriptive text association with visual elements
- Integration with drawing and imaging tools

**Example Use Case:** Dictation describing a chart creates a placeholder for the visual with attached descriptive text and formatting.
